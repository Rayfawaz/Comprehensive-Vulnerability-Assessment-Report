## Comprehensive-Vulnerability-Assessment-Report


#### **1. Introduction**
This assessment was conducted on the Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) using OWASP ZAP to identify and document vulnerabilities. 
The scan results provide insights into potential security flaws and weaknesses that could be exploited in real-world attacks.
The testing focused on common web application vulnerabilities such as missing security headers, cross-site scripting (XSS), session management issues, and information leakage.

#### **2. Summary of Findings**
The following table summarizes the number of alerts based on their risk and confidence levels:

| **Risk**         | **Confidence**      | **Count** |
|------------------|---------------------|-----------|
| High             | -                   | 0         |
| Medium           | High                | 1         |
| Medium           | Medium              | 1         |
| Medium           | Low                 | 1         |
| Low              | High                | 1         |
| Low              | Medium              | 2         |
| Informational    | High                | 2         |
| Informational    | Medium              | 3         |
| Informational    | Low                 | 1         |

#### **3. Key Vulnerabilities**

##### **3.1. Missing Content Security Policy (CSP) Header**
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence Level**: High
- **Description**: The application does not implement a Content Security Policy (CSP), which helps mitigate certain types of attacks such as XSS and data injection attacks.
- **Recommendation**: Implement a strict CSP to protect the web application from content injection attacks.


---

##### **3.2. Absence of Anti-CSRF Tokens**
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence Level**: Low
- **Description**: The application does not include Anti-CSRF tokens in forms, leaving it vulnerable to cross-site request forgery attacks.
- **Recommendation**: Add CSRF protection mechanisms by including unique tokens in forms and verifying them server-side.


---

##### **3.3. Private IP Disclosure**
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Confidence Level**: Medium
- **Description**: Internal IP addresses were disclosed in the response body. This could assist attackers in performing network reconnaissance.
- **Recommendation**: Ensure that internal IPs are not included in HTTP responses by configuring web server settings.


---

##### **3.4. Missing Anti-Clickjacking Header**
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence Level**: Medium
- **Description**: The application does not include the `X-Frame-Options` header, making it vulnerable to clickjacking attacks.
- **Recommendation**: Add the `X-Frame-Options` header to deny or restrict framing of the site.


---

#### **4. Informational Alerts**

##### **4.1. Information Disclosure - Sensitive Data in URLs**
- **Description**: Sensitive information, such as query parameters, was found in the URLs. This can lead to leakage if URLs are logged or shared.
- **Recommendation**: Avoid passing sensitive information through the URL. Use POST requests or session variables to handle sensitive data.


---

#### **5. Session Management Issues**
- **Session Management Response Identified**
- **Risk Level**: Informational
- **Description**: The applicationâ€™s session management system lacks certain security configurations, which could lead to session hijacking.
- **Recommendation**: Implement secure session management practices such as regenerating session IDs upon login and logout, enforcing HTTPS-only cookies, and setting the `HttpOnly` flag.


---

#### **6. Conclusion and Recommendations**
This vulnerability assessment on DVWA using OWASP ZAP identified several key areas for improvement in web security. 
While no high-risk vulnerabilities were detected, medium-risk issues such as missing security headers and CSRF protection need immediate attention. 
Implementing the recommended security practices will significantly enhance the security posture of the web application.
